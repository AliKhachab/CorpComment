## What is this project about?

This project is practice for making a forum-like web app where people can post their takes on certain companies, filtered by hashtags. (i.e. "#Logitech Love your products!" would upload a message which could be upvoted and expanded if the message was longer).

## Why build this project?

I worked on this to learn more about JavaScript, especially fetch() and HTTP requests like POST/GET/etc., uploading HTML to a web app while trying to prevent HTML injections, modifying HTML elements based on certain conditions through JavaScript, etc.
